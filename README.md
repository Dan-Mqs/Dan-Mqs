### About me

Software Developer based in Brazil.

I'm mostly focused in front-end technologies, but I'm also able to work my way in back-end too.

I've got knowledge in programming languages such as Javascript, Python and Java, and technologies such as React, Next and Django, always willing to learn some more.

Having a design background means that I also enjoy dealing with UI & UX aspects, and have a decent grasp in some design techniques as well as putting them into CSS (i.e.: CSS isn't always a pain to me)

Coming up with solutions to some issues might be challenging, but the feeling of solving such puzzles and seeing everything work is truly amazing â€“ and that is what fuels me.
