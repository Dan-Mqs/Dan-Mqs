### About me

I'm a Software Development Student, focusing on Web development. My goal is to become a front-end specialist. 

I've been dedicating into learning and practicing Javascript with React, Next and Node. Also looking forward to learn Vue, Django, Flutter, and always open to discover a new interesting technology.
